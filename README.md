Task-1 : Titanic Dataset Survival Prediction.

In this task I made use of data cleaning , imputational techniques , analysed the dataset using countplot.
Also made use of a machine learning algorithm known as Logistic Regression which firstly divided dataset into training and testing data 
and then calculated the accuracy score of dataset. Accuracy of training data is 80% and testing was around 78%.
